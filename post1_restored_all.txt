Strawberry Pie baking competition in Udderslake.
Udderslake 5th August:
['The'] yearly Heatherthorn Strawberry Pie baking competition took place ['this', 'thus'] year in
Udderslake on 4th and 5th August 1956. Mary Folkenlane from Rabbington emerged
['again'] as champion with ['her'] signature candy coated, cream laced strawberry pie. Chief
judge, Felton McCurlyfeather pointed ['out'] that it was not only Mary's talent as to rely
entirely on Heatherthorn's locally produced strawberries ( ['all'] strawberries were
sourced from her own farm), but it was precisely the delicately decorated pie crust
['that'] brought smiles ['of', 'on', 'or'] the faces of the panel ['of', 'on', 'or'] ['five', 'fire'] judges, as well as brought ['her', 'per'] the
final victory. ['Well'] done, Mary!
