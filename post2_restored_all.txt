Rare sighting of Kurangbaru bird spotted.
Rydham 2nd August:
Gwyn Winterburry ['from'] Rydham's birdwatcher society 'Wingspan' has reported ['yet'] ['one']
['more', 'made', 'move', 'mine'] sighting of the extremely rare silver-crested Kurangbaru bird in Collestorian Forest
near Rydham. Gwyn and fellow birdwatchers ['from'] Heatherthorn county, ['more', 'here', 'were', 'fire']
delighted to spot a pair of the elusive birds foraging for claycats at the muddy shorelines
of Lake Udder. The ['the', 'top', 'two', 'too', 'ten'] birds, completely oblivious ['about', 'after', 'again', 'above', 'along', 'among', 'alone'] all the attention bestowed on
[] were a sight to behold, as ['they'] gracefully took flight shortly ['after'] predawn.
Wingspan wishes them all the best as they continue ['their'] perilous journey to the
warmer waters of Spogridge sea.
