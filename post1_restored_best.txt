Strawberry Pie baking competition in Udderslake.
Udderslake 5th August:
<The> yearly Heatherthorn Strawberry Pie baking competition took place <this> year in
Udderslake on 4th and 5th August 1956. Mary Folkenlane from Rabbington emerged
<again> as champion with <her> signature candy coated, cream laced strawberry pie. Chief
judge, Felton McCurlyfeather pointed <out> that it was not only Mary's talent as to rely
entirely on Heatherthorn's locally produced strawberries ( <all> strawberries were
sourced from her own farm), but it was precisely the delicately decorated pie crust
<that> brought smiles <of> the faces of the panel <of> <five> judges, as well as brought <her> the
final victory. <Well> done, Mary!
