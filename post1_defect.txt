Strawberry Pie baking competition in Udderslake.
Udderslake 5th August:
T*e yearly Heatherthorn Strawberry Pie baking competition took place th*s year in
Udderslake on 4th and 5th August 1956. Mary Folkenlane from Rabbington emerged
a**in as champion with he* signature candy coated, cream laced strawberry pie. Chief
judge, Felton McCurlyfeather pointed o*t that it was not only Mary's talent as to rely
entirely on Heatherthorn's locally produced strawberries ( a*l strawberries were
sourced from her own farm), but it was precisely the delicately decorated pie crust
t**t brought smiles o* the faces of the panel o* f**e judges, as well as brought *er the
final victory. Wel* done, Mary!
